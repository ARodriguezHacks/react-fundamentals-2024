# Create React Elements

üë®‚Äçüíº Let's convert this to use React! But don't worry, we won't be doing any JSX just
yet... You're going to use raw React APIs here.

In modern applications you'll get React and React DOM files from a "package
registry" like [npm](https://npmjs.com) ([react](https://npm.im/react) and
[react-dom](https://npm.im/react-dom)).

<callout-info>
	ü¶â We'll be using a service called [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh) to load react
	and react-dom on the page as native ESM modules which will allow us to use
	`import` statements to import those without having to worry about build tools.
</callout-info>

We'll also use an
[import map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)
to help us avoid having to write the full URL for modules in our import statements.

Here's a simple example of the API:

```typescript
import { createElement } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

const elementProps = { id: 'element-id', children: 'Hello world!' }
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = createElement(elementType, elementProps)

const root = createRoot(rootElement)
root.render(reactElement)
```

"Props" is short for "properties" and they're a foundational part of React
elements. You can think of the element type as a blueprint for the kind of React
component to create and the props are the inputs for when React actually creates
that element.

`children` is a special prop. You can pass a single element like above, or an
array of children (if there's more than one). You can also pass the children as
any number of additional arguments:

```typescript
const elementProps = { id: 'element-id' }
const child1 = 'Hello'
const child2 = ' '
const child3 = 'world!'
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = createElement(
	elementType,
	elementProps,
	child1,
	child2,
	child3,
)
createRoot(rootElement).render(reactElement)
```

Alright! Let's do this!

	üí∞ Tip: `console.log` the `reactElement` to see what it looks like. You might
	find it kinda interesting!

			🐨 add an importmap for react and react-dom/client
			🦉 Without the importmap, you would have to do:
				import { createElement } from 'https://esm.sh/react@19.0.0-beta-94eed63c49-20240425?dev'
			which techincally works, but... 🤡

		<!-- 💰 because this is a workshop about react and not import maps, we'll just give this to you: -->
		<!-- <script type="importmap">
			{
				"imports": {
					"react": "https://esm.sh/react@19.0.0-beta-94eed63c49-20240425?dev",
					"react-dom/client": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@19.0.0-beta-94eed63c49-20240425/client?dev"
				}

		<div id="root"></div>

			// 🐨 createElement from react and createRoot from react-dom here
			const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')

			// You're going to re-implement this code using React!
			// 💣 So go ahead and delete this implementation (or comment it out for now)
			// These three lines are similar to createElement
			// 📜 https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement
			const element = document.createElement('div')
			element.className = 'container' // 💰 in React, this is also called the "className" prop
			element.textContent = 'Hello World' // 💰 in React, this is the "children" prop or a third argument
			// This is similar to createRoot().render()
			rootElement.append(element)

			// 🐨 Please replace all the DOM-related code above with React API calls
			// 💰 The example in the markdown file should be a good hint for you.

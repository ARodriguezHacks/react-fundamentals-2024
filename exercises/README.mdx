# React Fundamentals ‚öõ

üë®‚Äçüíº Hello! I'm Peter the Project Manager and I'm here to help you know what our
users want you to know so you can build the kind of React application they need!
In this workshop we're going to build on your knowledge of React elements and
custom components you got from the
[Get Started with React Workshop](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/get-started-with-react)
to give you the foundational knowledge you need upon which you can build your
React skills.

Our users are looking for type safety, styling, forms, error handling, and
rendering lists of data. We'll cover all of that and more in this series of
exercises.

As with all Epic React workshops, the goal is to help you not only use React,
but _understand_ it. This will help you build better applications and be more
effective at debugging when things go wrong.

Are you read? Let's go!

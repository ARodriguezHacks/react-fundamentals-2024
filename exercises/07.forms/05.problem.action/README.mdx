# Form Actions

👨‍💼 `onSubmit` handlers that prevent default and handle file uploads like this
are so common that React has a built-in way to do that! The `action` prop on a
form can accept a function! The function accepts a `formData` object.

In this exercise, create a function for logging the `formData` like we are
currently and delete all the superfluous props.
